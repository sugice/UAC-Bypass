## Description

Windows 10 introduces the brand new "Settings" app, which provides us with fresh
and new auto-elevated binaries. The entry point of this app is
SystemSettings.exe and the "Enter Product Key" dialog is in
SystemSettingsAdminFlows.exe, which is auto-elevated and vulnerable to
environment variable injection.

A load attempt to `%SYSTEMROOT%\System32\msctf.dll` will be performed from this
auto-elevated process.

How to change `%systemroot%`?

Simple: Through Volatile Environment.

Define your own `%systemroot%` in `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Volatile Environment` and
SystemSettingsAdminFlows.exe will load msctf.dll from there.

We need to execute SystemSettingsAdminFlows.exe, which is dependent on
SystemSettings.exe running. So, we first start the Settings app, then inject the
environment variable and then execute SystemSettingsAdminFlows.exe with the
"EnterProductKey" argument. The second executable will load our DLL.

For PoC, this is sufficient. However, this is a UI heavy PoC that causes visual
disturbances to the user. There are plenty of ways to mitigate visibility and
possibly avoid SystemSettings.exe altogether. However, I will not investigate
further than what is necessary to provide a functioning PoC, because this is the
sixth auto-elevation exploit that I've discovered and I'm focusing on different
techniques meanwhile posting anything I come across, like this here.

## Expected Result

When everything worked correctly, Payload.exe should be executed, displaying
basic information including integrity level.
