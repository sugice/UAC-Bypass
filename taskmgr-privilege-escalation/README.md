## Description

In taskmgr.exe, there is a DLL loading vulnerability that can be exploited by
injecting an environment variable.

A load attempt to `%SYSTEMROOT%\System32\srumapi.dll` and various other DLL's
will be performed from this auto-elevated process on Windows 10. In Windows 8,
shell32.dll will be loaded.

Redirecting `%SYSTEMROOT%` can be achieved through Volatile Environment. For
this, we set `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Volatile Environment\SYSTEMROOT` to a new
directory, which we then populate with our hijacked payload DLL, along with
*.clb files from `C:\Windows\Registration` as they are loaded from our new
directory as well.

Then, as we execute taskmgr.exe, it will load our payload DLL and on Windows 8
it will also load the COM+ components. We need to copy those, too, because the
process will otherwise crash. I have included them for Windows 10, too, even
though they are not currently required.

Our DLL is now executed with high IL. In this example, Payload.exe will be
started, which is an exemplary payload file displaying a MessageBox.

## Expected Result

When everything worked correctly, Payload.exe should be executed, displaying
basic information including integrity level.
